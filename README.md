This website is a collection consisting of many of the projects I shared to the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) coding community, displayed and organized in a way that makes them easy to browse. You can wander around and explore my creations or find just the ones you want by using the filters and search feature.

> [!NOTE]
> The collection is hand-picked and may not always be up to date. Additionally, some of my projects aren't shown in this collection. For everything, you can find me on Scratch [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/D-ScratchNinja/).
